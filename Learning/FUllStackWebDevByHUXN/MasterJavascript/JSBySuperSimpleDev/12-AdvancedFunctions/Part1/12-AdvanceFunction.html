        /*
            Disadvantages of below one:
            - Hoisting doesn't work if we create a anonoymous function like below one 

            - In Javascript functions are values:-
                - We can save it in a variable

            - what else can we do with a value
                - save a value in an object

        /*
            What else can we do with a value?
                - pass a value into a function

        // anything we can do with a value we can do with functions as well

            setTimeout():-
                - allows us to run a function in the future
                - it is a builtin function

                - 1st parameter is a function we want to run in the future
                - 2nd paramter : how long to wait before running this function (number in millisecond)
                1000 milliseconds = 1 second
        */

         setTimeout(function() {
            console.log('timeout');
            console.log('timeout2');
         },3000);
         
        /*
            Displays next line first and then after 3 second it display timeout so what's happening here why are they reversed
            bcuz setTimeout sets up a timer and after 3 seconds it will call this function however this actually doesn't actually wait for the 3 seconds to finish it just sets up the timer and immediately goes to the next line is displayed first 
            So this is called asynchronous code 

            Asynchronous Code :-
                - won't wait for a line to finish before going to the next line 
            
                Synchronous Code:-
                - Will wait for one line to finish before going to the next line

            - ALl the code we have written so far has been synchronous code 
            - IN addition all the code inside the function setTimeout() is also synchronous code

            - Don't worry, All the code we normally write will be synchronous code , It will run line by line as usual
            the only time that code becomes asynchronous is when we use certain features of JavaScript like setTimeout is the only part that is asynchronous.

            Advantage of setTimout is being asynchronous code :
            - It doesn't block our code for 3 seconds waiting for this timer to finish, it just sets up the timer in the background and then goes to the next line of code
            - This allow our code to do other things while this timer is running in the background and this is similar to real life

        //  Asynchronous code
        console.log('next line');

         /*
            setInterval is builtin function so we can 
            1st paramenter: A function we want to run in the future
            2nd paramter: 
         */
        setInterval(function() {
            console.log('interval');
        }, 3000);
        console.log('next line 2')
