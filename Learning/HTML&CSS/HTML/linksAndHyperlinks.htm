        <!-- Difference between linsk and hyperlinks
         Link:
- A general term that refers to any reference or connection from one resource to another. It can encompass various forms of connections, including physical links (like cables) or logical links (like references in documents).
Hyperlink:
- A specific type of link that is used in digital contexts, particularly on the internet. A hyperlink is an element in a digital document that links to another document or resource, which can be activated by clicking on it. Hyperlinks are typically formatted as text or images that, when clicked, direct the user to another location, such as a different webpage or a specific section within the same document. -->
