# Patterns

1. Most of the pattern have nested loop, most of the pattern will have two loops whereas the outer loops and there is a inner loop
   - outer loop is specifically for the lines (rows) and inner loops specifically for the columns
     i. For the outer loops count the number of lines (rows),
     this will determine what will outer loops are going to be
     ii. for the inner loops, focus on the coluns and connect them somehow to the rows
     iii. Print the whatever we are printing inside the inner for loop
     iv. Observer the symmtery [optional]
