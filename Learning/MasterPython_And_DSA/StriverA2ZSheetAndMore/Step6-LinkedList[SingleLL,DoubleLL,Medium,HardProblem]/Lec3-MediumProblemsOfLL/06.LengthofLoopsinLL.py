# Brute force

Time Complexity: O(N) The code traverses the entire linked list at least once, where 'N' is the number of nodes in the list. Therefore, the time complexity is linear, O(N).

Space Complexity: O(N) The code uses a hashmap/dictionary to store encountered nodes, which can take up to O(N) additional space, where â€˜N' is the number of nodes in the list. Hence, the space complexity is O(N) due to the use of the map to track nodes.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N) The code traverses the entire linked list once, where 'n' is the number of nodes in the list. This traversal has a linear time complexity, O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1) The code uses only a constant amount of additional space, regardless of the linked list's length. This is achieved by using two pointers (slow and fast) to detect the loop without any significant extra memory usage, resulting in constant space complexity, O(1).
