# Without bit manipulation

'''
Time Complexity: O(1), The XOR operation between two integers is performed in constant time, O(1). The for loop iterates over a fixed number of bits (32 bits for a standard integer), which is as good as O(1).

Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ Using a couple of variables i.e., constant space.
