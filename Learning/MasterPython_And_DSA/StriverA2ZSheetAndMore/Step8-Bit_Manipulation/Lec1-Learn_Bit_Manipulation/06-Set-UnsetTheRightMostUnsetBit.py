ğŸ•’ Time Complexity

Bitwise OR and addition are O(1) operations.

So the overall time complexity = O(1).


Why does this work?

Adding 1 to a number flips the rightmost 0 bit into 1 and makes all bits to its right into 0.

OR (|) with the original number sets that bit in the original n.


n       = 10  â†’ 1010 (binary)
n + 1   = 11  â†’ 1011
n | n+1 = 1010 | 1011 = 1011 â†’ 11


n       = 7   â†’ 0111
n + 1   = 8   â†’ 1000
n | n+1 = 0111 | 1000 = 1111 â†’ 15
