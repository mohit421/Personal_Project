'''
1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings
'''



'''
Complexity
Time complexity: O(n 
2
 )
Both the outer and inner loop runs n times.
The max() and min() are performed over at most 26 elements (aâ€“z), so they're constant time.
Space complexity: O(1)
The frequency counter holds at most 26 characters (lowercase English letters), so space is constant.
