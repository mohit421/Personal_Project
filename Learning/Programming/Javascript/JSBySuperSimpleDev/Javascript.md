<!-- Number and Math -->

- Computer have a problem working with floats.
- Calculations with floats are sometimes inacurate.
- When working with money
- It's best practce to do the calc in cents
- and convert back to dollar from cents

```
20.95+7.99 - give an inaccurate result
to avoid this we can calculate like
(2095+799)/100
```
