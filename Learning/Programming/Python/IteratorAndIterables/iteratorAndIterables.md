# Iterators and Iterables - What are they and how do they work?

    - Iterable :- On a higher level it simply means that it is something that can be looped over so for example a list is iterable because we can loop over a list

- There are lots of confusion related to these two terms, So I tried to make readme.md file to make you understand it better

- For example:-
  - Let's take an ex of list , a list is a interable but not a iterator
  - This readme.md file will make you feel betterr to understand that when something is iterables and something is iterator
  - We will also learn how to make an object ourselves that is both an iterable and an iterator
