collections.Counter()
A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

Sample Code

>>> from collections import Counter
>>>
>>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
>>> print Counter(myList)
Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).items()
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).keys()
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).values()
[3, 4, 4, 2, 1]
```

```
itertools.combinations_with_replacement(iterable, r)
This tool returns  length subsequences of elements from the input iterable allowing individual elements to be repeated more than once.

Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sorted order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order.

Sample Code

>>> from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
>>>
>>> print list(combinations_with_replacement('12345',2))
[('1', '1'), ('1', '2'), ('1', '3'), ('1', '4'), ('1', '5'), ('2', '2'), ('2', '3'), ('2', '4'), ('2', '5'), ('3', '3'), ('3', '4'), ('3', '5'), ('4', '4'), ('4', '5'), ('5', '5')]
>>>
>>> A = [1,1,3,3,3]
>>> print list(combinations(A,2))
[(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3)]

```

DefaultDict:-
The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.
# For example:

from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
d['python'].append("awesome")
d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
d['python'].append("language")
for i in d.items():
    print i
This prints:

('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
('something-else', ['not relevant'])
```

# Collection namedTuples

- collections.namedtuple()
- Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.
- They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.
- With namedtuples, you don’t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.

```
Example

Code 01

>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> Point = namedtuple('Point','x,y')
>>> pt1 = Point(1,2)
>>> pt2 = Point(3,4)
>>> dot_product = ( pt1.x * pt2.x ) +( pt1.y * pt2.y )
>>> print dot_product
11
Code 02

>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> Car = namedtuple('Car','Price Mileage Colour Class')
>>> xyz = Car(Price = 100000, Mileage = 30, Colour = 'Cyan', Class = 'Y')
>>> print xyz
Car(Price=100000, Mileage=30, Colour='Cyan', Class='Y')
>>> print xyz.Class
Y
```

# collections.OrderedDict

- An OrderedDict is a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys that were inserted first. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged.

```
Example

Code

>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>>
>>> ordinary_dictionary = {}
>>> ordinary_dictionary['a'] = 1
>>> ordinary_dictionary['b'] = 2
>>> ordinary_dictionary['c'] = 3
>>> ordinary_dictionary['d'] = 4
>>> ordinary_dictionary['e'] = 5
>>>
>>> print ordinary_dictionary
{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'e': 5, 'd': 4}
>>>
>>> ordered_dictionary = OrderedDict()
>>> ordered_dictionary['a'] = 1
>>> ordered_dictionary['b'] = 2
>>> ordered_dictionary['c'] = 3
>>> ordered_dictionary['d'] = 4
>>> ordered_dictionary['e'] = 5
>>>
>>> print ordered_dictionary
OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)])

```
