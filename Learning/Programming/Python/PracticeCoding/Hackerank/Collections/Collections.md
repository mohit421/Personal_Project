collections.Counter()
A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

Sample Code

>>> from collections import Counter
>>>
>>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
>>> print Counter(myList)
Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).items()
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).keys()
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).values()
[3, 4, 4, 2, 1]
```

itertools.combinations_with_replacement(iterable, r)
This tool returns  length subsequences of elements from the input iterable allowing individual elements to be repeated more than once.

Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sorted order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order.

Sample Code

>>> from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
>>>
>>> print list(combinations_with_replacement('12345',2))
[('1', '1'), ('1', '2'), ('1', '3'), ('1', '4'), ('1', '5'), ('2', '2'), ('2', '3'), ('2', '4'), ('2', '5'), ('3', '3'), ('3', '4'), ('3', '5'), ('4', '4'), ('4', '5'), ('5', '5')]
>>>
>>> A = [1,1,3,3,3]
>>> print list(combinations(A,2))
[(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3)]
